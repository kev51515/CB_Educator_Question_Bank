# LMS Features

A catalog of the complete feature space for this SAT-prep LMS — built, partially built, unbuilt, and explicitly out of scope. Treat this as a reference menu so future feature decisions can be made by selecting from a known surface rather than re-brainstorming.

## 1. How to read this doc

`docs/LMS_ROADMAP.md` is the prioritized BUILD path: the next four weeks, opinionated about which gaps to close. This doc is a CATALOG — every feature plausibly relevant to an LMS or test-prep product, including ones we will deliberately never build. The point is a map of the territory.

Each feature has a status tag, brief description, and (for unbuilt items) an effort tag and one-line schema/UI sketch. Status tags:

- **✓ Built** — works today, can point at the file
- **◐ Partial** — built but unwired, missing a critical piece, or only one side of the loop exists
- **○ Not built** — no code yet
- **✗ Out of scope** — deliberately won't build, with rationale in section 5

Effort tags: **S** (hours), **M** (days), **L** (week-plus), **XL** (multi-week). All status claims were verified against the codebase. If you change a feature's status, update this doc.

## 2. The feature tree

### A. Identity + access control

### E2. Proctoring + test security

See `docs/PROCTORING.md` for the full stack + SEB integration plan. Shipped in commit `2168c1e` (migrations `0108`–`0109`, 2026-06-05). Honest ceiling: browser-based proctoring can't stop a second device, a second person, or a screenshot — it's deterrence + a human-reviewed record (see section 5).

| `ProctorTimeline` teacher UI (live + review) | ✓ Built | Time-scaled track + summary chips in the live monitor and post-test review |
| Auto-flagging ("⚑ Needs review") | ✓ Built | Suspicious attempts auto-flag and sort to the top of the teacher list |
| Strict mode (enforced fullscreen + copy/paste blocking) | ✓ Built | Fails open gracefully on iPhone (no element fullscreen) with telemetry still recording |
| Hard lockdown via Safe Exam Browser (SEB) | ○ Not built | L; design-only (`docs/PROCTORING.md` §3). Win/macOS/iPad only (no Chromebook/Android); gated on a device-fleet survey. For high-stakes mock-test-day |

## 3. Cross-cutting capabilities

These aren't user-facing features but unblock entire categories above. Each is referenced repeatedly in section 2.

- **Resend transactional email** — wired into `assignment-due-reminders`. Still need: general `email_outbox` + drain for arbitrary notifications, account verification mail, bulk roster invites.
- **Supabase Storage** — enabled for materials (H). Still unblocks: profile avatars (C), PDF report export (G).
- **Edge Functions with cron triggers** — `0031_cron_schedules.sql` binds the anon-cleanup and reminder jobs. Headroom for: outbox drain, weekly digests, mark-as-late jobs.
- **Supabase Realtime subscriptions** — used by `useTeacherClasses` and the notification bell. Still unblocks: live-class mode, presence indicators.
- **Background workers**. Heavy compute we don't want on the request path: PDF rendering, real score-prediction model, skill mastery refresh at scale.
- **i18n provider**. Cheap to add now; retrofitting after the string count doubles is annoying. Soft prerequisite for international expansion.
- **A persisted server-side per-user state store** (replace `localStorage` for bank features). Unblocks: cross-device study state (F), bookmarks/notes that survive a new phone.
- **Real SAT calibration cohort** — 50+ submitted attempts with known true scores. Unblocks moving score predictions from linear-v1 to a real scaled model (E, G, M).

## 4. Suggested feature pairings

Some features only really pay off when shipped with a partner. The good pairs:

- **Per-class gradebook + Item analysis** — gradebook is in; class-aggregate item analysis is the next half of this pair. With both, "class bombed assignment 3" lands on "because question 7 had a 20% correct rate."
- **Real scaled score predictions + Personalized study plans** — linear-v1 + heatmap exist, but the predicted number isn't trustworthy yet and there's no "do these 20 questions" handoff. Calibrate the model and ship a plan generator in the same sprint.
- **Bulk roster import + Co-teachers** — bulk import shipped; the moment one teacher onboards a whole school they want a colleague to share the load. Co-teachers is now the dangling half.
- **Reply notifications + Email digests + Push** — in-app bell and assignment-due mail exist; daily/weekly digests, reply mail, and Web Push close the broadcast loop so students who don't log in daily still hear teachers.
- **Materials + Pages** — materials/links ship; pages/wiki is the missing half so teachers can write lesson context alongside the PDFs.
- **Skill mastery + Vocabulary builder + SRS** — heatmap is in; vocab builder + the existing FSRS-lite hook complete the three pillars of SAT-prep retention.
- **Account deletion + GDPR export** — export RPC shipped; the deletion side and a confirm modal complete the GDPR pair.

## 5. Anti-features (deliberately not building)

- **LTI tool provider** — this app is the destination, not an embed. Weeks of compliance work for a use case nobody asked for.
- **ePortfolios** — test prep doesn't produce essays, projects, or reflections worth curating.
- **Live web conferencing** — Zoom and Google Meet exist. A URL field on the class is sufficient.
- **Course catalog / marketplace browsing** — teachers create classes and invite students; nobody self-enrolls in "SAT Prep With Mr. Wu Spring 2026."
- **Discussions-as-grading-tool** — a Canvas pattern that doesn't translate to SAT MCQ pedagogy.
- **Plagiarism detection** — auto-graded multiple choice doesn't have a plagiarism failure mode.
- **Rubrics + SpeedGrader** — 80% UI for 0% answered when there's nothing to grade subjectively.
- **External standards alignment (Common Core etc.)** — the SAT skill taxonomy already provides the signal Outcomes provides. Mapping is a content authoring problem, not engineering.
- **Native mobile apps (Capacitor / RN)** — the PWA covers the use case. Revisit only if a school requires App Store distribution.
- **College Board API / live item sync** — there is no such partner API.
- **Essay scoring** — SAT essay was retired in 2021. Build only if it returns.
- **Course catalog Browse** — not a marketplace.

## 6. The shipping playbook

For any tier-1 feature in section 2, the recommended sequence — and the one this codebase rewards — is:

1. **DB schema first.** Write the migration. New table goes through the `0001_init.sql` template: `IF NOT EXISTS`, enable RLS, helper-function-based policies with `-- Why:` comments, indexes for the read paths the UI will use. Migrations are sequentially numbered with no gaps.
2. **RPC if multi-row mutation or invariant enforcement is needed.** Anything beyond a single direct `from('table').insert(...)` that fits RLS belongs in a `SECURITY DEFINER` function. Stable string error codes. Returns the affected row or `RETURNS TABLE(...)`, never `void`. `REVOKE ALL FROM PUBLIC; GRANT EXECUTE TO authenticated;`.
3. **Hook in `feature/useFooBar.ts`.** Standard return shape: `{ data, loading, error, refresh }`. `error` typed `string | null`. Realtime subscription only if there's a real edit-collision case; clean up via `supabase.removeChannel`.
4. **Component co-located with the hook.** Function component, named `interface FooProps`, JSDoc header, Tailwind palette inside indigo/violet/emerald/rose/slate, modals matching `ClassFormModal` structure. No `any`, no `React.FC`, no icon library, no emojis in UI strings.
5. **Wire into the route surface.** `AuthGate.tsx` is the single point that switches on role/session/area. Nested navigation inside a role surface is a local state machine in the parent — no router library.

For every step, the rubric is `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 8. If a feature in section 2 above ever moves from ○ to ✓ without conforming to that rubric, the audit will catch it. The catalog stays honest only if status tags stay honest — when you ship a feature, find its row here and update the tag in the same PR.
